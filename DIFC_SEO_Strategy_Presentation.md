## Slide 8: Technical Audit - Crawling & Indexation
*Data Source: Screaming Frog / Google 'site:' search*

- **Canonicalization:** Present on key templates; ensures clean indexing.
- **Issues Found:** 
    - [Insert specific 404s or redirect chains if found]
    - Duplicate content risks on [specific sections].
- **Recommendation:** Implement monthly technical crawls to monitor healthy indexation.

---

## Slide 9: Technical Audit - Site Speed & Core Web Vitals (CWV)
*Data Source: PageSpeed Insights*
- **Mobile Score:** [Insert Score, e.g., 55/100] (Needs Improvement)
- **Desktop Score:** [Insert Score, e.g., 90/100] (Good)
- **Key Metrics (Mobile):**

    - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): 0.05 (Good)
- **Impact:** Slow mobile LCP affects rankings and user experience for "restaurants/events" queries.
- **Fixes:** Optimize images (WebP), defer non-critical JS, implement stronger caching.

---

## Slide 10: Mobile-Friendliness & UX
- **Status:** Responsive, but navigation is complex.
- **Observations:**
    - Critical "Business Setup" paths require multiple taps.
    - User journey for mobile "lifestyle" searchers could be smoother.
- **Recommendation:** 
    - Streamline mobile menu for key actions.
    - Add sticky "Make an Enquiry" CTA on business pages.

---

## Slide 11: Site Architecture & Internal Linking
- **Strengths:** Clear top-level separation (Business / Experience / Ecosystem).
- **Gaps:** 
    - Siloed content: Blogs don't always link to relevant "Business" service pages.
    - Lifestyle content not fully aggregated (e.g., a "Best Restaurants" hub).
- **Opportunity:** Create dedicated "Hub Pages":
    - `/business/setup-guide`
    - `/experience/dining-guide`
    - `/ecosystem/family-wealth`

---

## Slide 12: On-Page SEO - Titles & Headings
- **Finding:** Title tags often miss high-value locations or value props.
    - *Current:* "Business in DIFC"
    - *Improved:* "Set Up Business in DIFC – Dubai’s Leading Financial Hub"
- **Structure:** Ensure strict H1 > H2 > H3 hierarchy.
- **Action:** Retag top 20 landing pages with "Keyword + Benefit + Dubai/DIFC" formula.

---

## Slide 13: Content Gaps
**High-Value Opportunities Missing:**
1. **Detailed Setup Guides:** Step-by-step "How to open a company in DIFC".
2. **Comparison Content:** "DIFC vs. other Free Zones" (Decision support).

- **Opportunities:**

    - **Partner Program:** Systematically get links from tenant law firms, consultancies, and retailers ("Located in DIFC").
