DIFC is ranks high and has great traffic and have 
high authority score, everyone knows DIFC, 
yes they have technical and on-page issues that will
reinforce their ranking position, but there is good 
keywords gap for long tail keywords that has specifc 
user intent which can also increase traffic but most 
importantly enhance the converion funnel of the site.
the focus is to re-write the content to be more conversion driven
decrease broadness, and be more clear to the solutions and value propositions.

Todays SEO is not about traffic from search engine, its more of understanding 
user intent and create the perefect user flow in the funnel to convert

no fluff here DIFC needs to fix the hubs and have clear content startegy for 
highly converting keywords to optimize the content to match the intent.
ther receive large amount of traffic but what is the conversion rate what is the bounce rate
this is the strategy for DIFC beside E.E.A.T to keep and increase AI generative search results
This is what SEO today about for DIFC not prediction of keywords and claims is not true.

we need to go slide by slide and re-create or fix them to tell our findings
this is the reality for DIFC and must be challenged.

why i want to sell more traffic to DIFC and they already have, we need to look at their main pages and see their 
signiture problem and advocate for it for the sake of time and productivity.

Remember we want to stay in SEO realm but focus on conversion and user intent. 
at the end we want realistic results and not claims.
