what is this site about and what is there SEO objectives and what needs to do for there SEO

1. What this site is about

This is the website of DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre). In simple terms, it:

Positions DIFC as a leading global financial hub in the Middle East.
Promotes DIFC as a business destination (licensing, regulation, legal system, public register of companies).
Promotes DIFC as a lifestyle destination (dining, retail, events, residences, offices).
Showcases its ecosystem (Academy, Innovation Hub, Family Wealth Centre, Sustainability).
Shares news, blogs, podcasts, and events to keep stakeholders updated.
So the core themes are: finance hub + business setup + lifestyle community + thought leadership.

2. Likely SEO objectives

From the content and structure, the main SEO goals are probably:

Attract businesses and financial institutions

Rank for terms like “Dubai financial centre”, “set up business in DIFC”, “financial hub Middle East”, “Dubai asset management hub”, etc.
Drive enquiries for licensing, office space, and registrations.
Promote the DIFC ecosystem & services

Academy: “executive education Dubai”, “financial training UAE”, etc.
Innovation Hub: “fintech hub Dubai”, “startup ecosystem Dubai”, etc.
Family Wealth Centre: “family office Dubai”, “UHNW wealth management centre”, etc.
Promote DIFC as a lifestyle destination

“Restaurants in DIFC”, “things to do in DIFC”, “events in DIFC”, “shopping in DIFC”, “DIFC residences / offices”.
Thought leadership & brand authority

Rank and be visible for finance-related insights: “future of finance Dubai”, “global economics podcast UAE”, “intergenerational wealth structuring” etc.
Lead generation & engagement

Drive enquiry forms, newsletter sign‑ups, event registrations, and property enquiries.
3. What they need to do for SEO (at a high level)

A. Structure & content

Create/strengthen dedicated landing pages for each key intent:

“Business in DIFC” → clear pages for: setting up a company, licensing types, costs, benefits, sectors.
“Experience DIFC” → separate optimized sections for: dining, retail, events, art, wellness, sports.
Properties → separate SEO-friendly pages for each property (Heights Tower, Immersive Tower, DIFC Square, DIFC Living) with detailed content.
Ecosystem (Academy, Innovation Hub, Family Wealth Centre, Sustainability) → deeper, keyword-focused content.
On-page optimisation:

Unique title tags & meta descriptions per page with primary keywords and location (Dubai/UAE).
Clear H1/H2 structure using target keywords:
e.g., “Set Up Your Financial Business in DIFC – Dubai’s Leading Financial Hub”.
Internal links between related sections (e.g., from blogs to “Business in DIFC” or from “What’s On” to event pages).
High-quality informational content:

Guides: “How to set up a company in DIFC”, “Why choose DIFC over other free zones”, etc.
Lifestyle pieces: “Best restaurants in DIFC”, “Weekend guide to DIFC”.
Investor/wealth content: “How to structure a family office in DIFC”.
Localized content around big events (Expo-related, COP-like sustainability events, financial conferences).
B. Technical SEO

Ensure fast performance (Core Web Vitals): optimize images, caching, minify JS/CSS.
Mobile‑first: many users search on mobile for “restaurants in DIFC”, “events in DIFC”.
Clean URL structure (e.g., /business/, /experience/, /whats-on/, /properties/difc-heights).
Add and maintain XML sitemap and robots.txt.
Implement schema markup:
Organization, FinancialService, EducationalOrganization, Event, Place, LocalBusiness, Product (for properties), BlogPosting, NewsArticle, PodcastEpisode.
This can improve rich results (events, breadcrumbs, FAQs, etc.).
C. Local & “things to do” SEO

Optimize for local intent:

Clear NAP (Name, Address, Phone) on the site.
For lifestyle: structured pages listing restaurants, cafes, galleries, gyms in DIFC with descriptions.
Encourage partners (restaurants, galleries, brands) to mention “Located in DIFC” and link back.
If they haven’t already, ensure a strong Google Business Profile for DIFC as a place/district and/or key properties/events spaces.

D. Content marketing & authority building

Consistent blogs, news, and insights targeting:
Financial regulation, fintech, innovation, wealth management.
Market reports: “State of Fintech in MENA”, “Dubai as a global wealth hub”, etc.
Podcasts & thought leadership: optimize episode pages with transcripts and keywords.
Earn backlinks:
From financial publications, government sites, chambers of commerce, universities, event partners.
Collaboration with global financial centres, conferences, and major tenants.
E. Conversion-focused optimisation

Ensure key pages include:
Clear CTAs: “Make an Enquiry”, “Book a Visit”, “Download Brochure”.
Short forms and tracking with analytics & goals (enquiries, signups, event registrations).
Use SEO landing pages tailored to search queries that funnel into enquiries.
F. Ongoing SEO

Track rankings for target terms (e.g., “Dubai financial centre”, “fintech hub Dubai”, “DIFC restaurants”).
Monitor organic traffic, engagement, and conversion for each major section.
Update content frequently, especially What’s On, offers, and insights, to signal freshness.

How to use this keyword map

Assign one primary keyword + 2–4 secondary keywords to each page.
Use the primary keyword in: page title, H1, intro paragraph, URL (where possible).
Use secondary keywords naturally in subheadings and body text.
Link internally between related pages (“Business in DIFC” → “DIFC Public Register”, “Innovation Hub”, etc.).
If you tell me which section you’re working on first (e.g., “Business in DIFC” or “Experience DIFC”), I can draft a sample SEO page outline with headings and copy ideas using this keyword map.


let me tell you what im about to do and why im asking you these questions, i had an SEO interview and i passed and they provide me with an SEO assignment to do: Work on this assignment; you can finalize it within two business days. Brief – https://www.difc.com/ 1. SEO Strategy and direction 2. Technical SEO audit a. Technical b. On-Page Content c. Off-Page 3. Keyword identification & prioritization 4. Competitive landscape 5. Improvement opportunities 6. Clear KPIs setup Delivery guideline: ● It is recommended that the presentation should be no more than 35 slides. ● The structure of the slides, as mentioned in the deliverables, can be challenged. ● Providing the source of the insights used to create the strategy is not required. ● The delivered document is to be presented in a maximum of 40 Minutes. Ensure that all your observations and recommendations are supported by data and measurable metrics. Use available tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, Moz, PageSpeed Insights, Frog and any other third-party tools for analyzing performance and identifying issues. Support each recommendation with relevant data points (e.g., traffic, rankings, page load speed) and, where possible, try to include industry benchmarks or projections to justify your strategies.

You’ve got a solid brief. Let’s turn it into a clear, data‑backed deck you can actually present.
Below is a suggested structure + what to say on each part + where to get the data.

1. Overall deck structure (25–30 slides target)
You don’t need 35 slides; 22–30 strong slides with numbers and focus is ideal:

Title & agenda (1–2 slides)
Quick business & SEO context (2–3)
SEO strategy & direction (3–4)
Technical SEO audit (6–8)
Technical
On‑page content
Off‑page
Keyword identification & prioritisation (3–4)
Competitive landscape (3–4)
Improvement opportunities / roadmap (4–5)
KPIs & expected impact (2–3)
Closing & next steps (1)
I’ll walk you through what to put in each and how to make it look “data‑driven” even with limited tools.

2. Slide‑by‑slide guidance
1) Title & Agenda
Slide 1 – Title

“DIFC.com – SEO Strategy & Audit Assignment”
Your name, role (SEO Specialist / Consultant), date.
Slide 2 – Agenda

Business context & SEO goals
Strategy & direction
Technical, on‑page, off‑page audit
Keyword & competitive review
Opportunities & roadmap
KPIs & measurement
2) Business & SEO context
Slide 3 – What is DIFC.com about?
Bullet points summarising (from earlier):

Leading financial hub in the MENA region (licensing, regulation, legal system).
Ecosystem: Innovation Hub, Academy, Family Wealth Centre, Sustainability.
Lifestyle & real estate: dining, retail, events, offices, residences.
Audience: financial institutions, startups/fintech, family offices, UHNWIs, professionals, visitors.
Slide 4 – Business objectives translated to SEO objectives

Align business goals to SEO:

Attract new financial/innovation businesses → organic leads for “set up in DIFC”, “fintech hub Dubai”…
Promote ecosystem products (Academy, Innovation Hub, Family Wealth Centre).
Boost lifestyle & destination visibility (“restaurants in DIFC”, “events in DIFC”).
Strengthen global brand & thought leadership (insights, podcasts, reports).
Show this as a simple 2‑column table: “Business objective” → “SEO objective”.

3) SEO Strategy & Direction
Slide 5 – Strategic positioning

Main message:
“Become the dominant organic destination for ‘finance + innovation + wealth + lifestyle’ in Dubai”

Split strategy into 3 pillars:

Acquire – capture high‑intent searchers (business setup, family office, fintech, office space).
Educate – thought leadership content for finance, innovation, wealth, sustainability.
Engage – events, lifestyle, offers; keep residents/visitors coming back.
Slide 6 – Core SEO pillars

You can frame the entire strategy on 4 pillars:

Technical excellence (fast, crawlable, structured).
Information architecture & content depth (clear journeys: Business / Ecosystem / Lifestyle / Properties).
Authority & E‑E‑A‑T (backlinks, expert content, partners).
Measurement & optimisation (clear KPIs; regular iteration).
Use this slide to show you understand SEO is not just “keywords”, but platform + content + authority.

Slide 7 – Focus by audience / funnel

Optional but powerful:

Top of funnel:

“Dubai financial centre”, “fintech hub Dubai”, “events in DIFC”.
Mid funnel:

“set up business in DIFC”, “family office Dubai DIFC”, “executive education Dubai DIFC”.
Bottom funnel:

“contact DIFC”, “lease office in DIFC”, “register company in DIFC”.
Show intent mapping: Awareness → Consideration → Conversion.

4) Technical SEO Audit
You won’t have their GA or GSC, but you can still show a process and use public tools.

4.1 Technical
Slide 8 – Crawling & indexation

Use: Screaming Frog (limited crawl), site:difc.com in Google, and inspect a few template URLs.

Check: number of indexable pages, 4xx/5xx errors, redirect chains, canonical tags.
Add 3–5 bullets such as:
“Site appears to have X indexable URLs (sample from ‘site:difc.com’).”
“Canonical tags present on key templates (Home, Business, Experience).”
“Recommend: monthly technical crawl with Screaming Frog to track 4xx, 3xx, and canonicals.”
Even if things look mostly fine, list a checklist of what you reviewed.

Slide 9 – Site speed & Core Web Vitals

Use: PageSpeed Insights on a few key pages (Home, Business Landing, Experience, a property page).

Present numbers (just run them yourself quickly):

Mobile score: e.g., 45–70 (write actual score you see).
Desktop score: e.g., 80–95.
CLS, LCP, FID (or INP).
Explain impact:

“Mobile LCP ~3.5–4.0s on home; aim <2.5s.”
“Render‑blocking JS/CSS and large images main issues.”
Recommendations:

Image optimisation (WebP/AVIF, compression, responsive sizes).
Reduce render‑blocking resources; defer non‑critical JS.
Implement caching & CDN rules.
Regular CWV audits via PSI / Search Console.
Slide 10 – Mobile‑friendliness & UX

Use: Mobile Friendly Test or just viewport inspection.

Check:

Responsive layout, tap target size, nav on mobile.
Are main CTAs (“Make an Enquiry”, “View All Properties”) easily reachable?
Bullets:

“Site is mobile‑responsive but top navigation is complex; key business actions require multiple taps.”
“Recommendation: streamline mobile nav for business setup & enquiries, create sticky CTA for ‘Make an Enquiry’.”
Slide 11 – Site architecture & internal linking

From what we saw:

Pros:

Clear top‑level categories: Business / Experience / Ecosystem / What’s On / Properties.
Public Register / Legal Database well separated.
Gaps:

Some journeys may not be obvious: e.g., from Blogs/Insights → Business in DIFC.
Lifestyle content may not be clearly grouped for “restaurants in DIFC”, “events in DIFC”.
Recommendations:

Create/strengthen hub pages:
/business/
/experience/ (sub‑hubs: dining, retail, art, wellness, events)
/ecosystem/ (Academy, Innovation Hub, Family Wealth Centre, Sustainability)
Add contextual internal links from insights/news to these hubs.
4.2 On‑Page Content
Slide 12 – On‑page SEO: titles, headings, content

Sample a few key pages and show typical issues:

Titles might not fully leverage location + value proposition.
Example improvement:

Current: “Business in DIFC”
Improved: “Business in DIFC – Set Up in Dubai’s Leading Financial Centre”
H1/H2: ensure only one H1, descriptive and keyword‑aligned.

Thin content on some key areas (e.g., if “Business in DIFC” doesn’t deeply explain licensing, sectors, process).

Recommendations:

Create standard optimisation template:
Title length 50–60 chars, include target keyword + “Dubai / DIFC”.
Meta description 140–160 chars, highlight benefit + CTA.
Use H2s for structure: “Why DIFC?”, “Licensing & Sectors”, “How to Set Up”, “Frequently Asked Questions”.
Slide 13 – Content coverage & intent gaps

Use your keyword map and compare to existing pages:

Lack of detailed guides on:
“How to set up a company in DIFC (step‑by‑step)”.
“Family office setup in DIFC vs other jurisdictions”.
“Fintech startup journey in the DIFC Innovation Hub”.
“Comprehensive list: restaurants in DIFC, things to do in DIFC”.
List 3–5 high‑value content gaps that could drive relevant organic traffic.

4.3 Off‑Page
Slide 14 – Off‑page & authority

Use: Ahrefs/SEMrush/Moz free checks (backlink overview for difc.com).

Show 3 things:

Approximate Domain Authority / Domain Rating.
Number of referring domains (e.g., X domains, Y backlinks).
Types of sites linking (government, news, partner institutions).
Then:

Strength: strong brand; many natural links expected from news & partners.
Opportunities:
Systematic digital PR for major announcements, reports, events.
Partnerships: link placements from tenant companies, law firms, universities, event partners.
Global financial centre networks.
5) Keyword Identification & Prioritisation
Use the keyword map we built as your base.

Slide 15 – Keyword universe (by theme)

Table: columns = Theme | Example Primary Keywords | Intent | Priority

Rows:

Business setup
Financial / professional services
Ecosystem (Innovation Hub, Academy, Family Wealth Centre)
Properties (offices, residences)
Lifestyle (restaurants, events, art)
Slide 16 – Prioritisation framework

Show how you decide what comes first:

Axes:

Business impact (how close to revenue/strategic goal).
Search demand (volume) and competition.
Current performance (are we already ranking?).
Then show tiers:

Tier 1 (first 3–6 months)

“set up business in difc”, “difc company formation”, “fintech hub dubai”, “family office dubai difc”, “offices in difc”, “restaurants in difc”.
Tier 2 (6–12 months)

“executive education in dubai difc”, “sustainable finance dubai”, “events in difc”, “difc academy courses”.
Tier 3 (supportive / long‑tail)

Long questions, specific course names, individual property long‑tails.
Slide 17 – Example keyword → page mapping

Pick 3–5 critical keywords and show where they belong:

“set up business in difc” → /business/ (and a dedicated “How to set up” guide).
“family office dubai” → Family Wealth Centre page.
“fintech hub dubai” → Innovation Hub page.
“restaurants in difc” → Experience / Dining hub page.
This shows you can translate research into IA and on‑page plans.

6) Competitive Landscape
You don’t need perfect data; just a smart, realistic view.

Slide 18 – Main organic competitors

Group into:

Regional financial free zones / centres

ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market)
Dubai free zones (e.g., DMCC, DWTC, etc.)
Alternative international hubs (content competitors)

Singapore (MAS / financial districts), London, etc.
But focus on MENA in your slides.
Local lifestyle & property competition

Time Out / What’s On for “restaurants in DIFC” type queries.
Property portals (Bayut, Property Finder) for “offices in DIFC”.
Slide 19 – Comparative keyword coverage (illustrative)

Use SEMrush / Ahrefs for a quick look at:

Number of ranking keywords (DIFC vs ADGM vs DMCC).
Top overlapping keywords (e.g., “financial free zone dubai”, “business setup in dubai free zones”).
You don’t need exact numbers; even “DIFC ranks for ~X organic keywords, ADGM ~Y; overlap around business setup / free zone terms” is good.

Slide 20 – Competitive content examples

Show 2–3 examples:

ADGM / DMCC “Set up a business” pages – usually have:
Clear step‑by‑step process
Sector lists
Cost/fees information
FAQs
Then say:

“DIFC can match and exceed these with better guides, sector landing pages, and thought leadership pieces.”
7) Improvement Opportunities & Roadmap
Slide 21 – High‑impact opportunities (summary)

Group them:

Technical – speed + structured data + crawl hygiene.
Content & IA – new hub pages & guides.
Authority & PR – systematic backlink strategy.
Conversion – better funnel from organic visits to enquiries.
Slide 22 – Content & IA actions

Examples:

Create / improve Business in DIFC landing as a full guide:

Why DIFC, sectors, licensing types, step‑by‑step process, timelines, FAQs, CTAs.
Build Experience → Dining, Experience → Retail, Experience → Art & Culture, with SEO copy for “restaurants in DIFC”, “things to do in DIFC”, “DIFC art galleries”.

Deepen Ecosystem pages:

Innovation Hub: journey for fintech/startup from idea to scale.
Academy: detailed courses, use cases, FAQs.
Family Wealth Centre: clear proposition for family offices & UHNWIs.
Slide 23 – Technical & structured data actions

Improve Core Web Vitals (from your PSI findings).
Implement / extend schema markup:
Organization, FinancialService, EducationalOrganization, Event, LocalBusiness, Place, BlogPosting, NewsArticle, PodcastEpisode.
Regular crawl audits and broken link / redirect cleanup.
Slide 24 – Off‑page & E‑E‑A‑T actions

Launch content‑driven campaigns:

Annual reports (e.g., “State of Fintech in MENA”) with PR outreach.
Event campaigns (DIFC Sculpture Park, major conferences).
Partner backlink program:

Encourage tenants, law firms, consultancies, and academic partners to reference and link to their DIFC presence.
Highlight case studies where DIFC enabled growth – get those referenced outside.
Slide 25 – CRO & User journey

On key organic entry pages, add:
Strong CTAs: “Make an Enquiry”, “Book a Consultation”, “Download Brochure”.
Clear forms and tracking (via GA events/goals).
Internal links to related high‑intent pages.
8) KPIs & Measurement
Slide 26 – KPI framework

Split KPIs by layer:

Visibility

Organic impressions
Rank positions for priority keywords
Share of voice vs main competitors (for a tracked keyword set)
Traffic & engagement

Organic sessions to key sections: Business, Ecosystem, Experience, Properties.
Bounce rate / engagement rate, pages per session, time on page.
Conversions

Enquiry form submissions (segmented by page/source).
Newsletter sign‑ups.
Event registrations.
Property enquiries (offices/residences).
Slide 27 – Example targets (first 12 months)

You can set realistic hypothetical targets (they know you don’t see current baselines):

+30–50% organic traffic to “Business in DIFC” section.
Top 3 for “set up business in difc”, “fintech hub dubai”, “family office dubai difc”.
+20–30% organic enquiries from business‑related pages.
+30% organic sessions to lifestyle content (restaurants/events in DIFC) ahead of major event seasons.
Mention that actual numbers would be refined with baseline data from GA/GSC.

9) Closing
Slide 28 – 3‑phase roadmap

High‑level:

Phase 1 (0–3 months)

Deep technical audit, quick wins (speed, meta tags, internal links).
Keyword & content plan finalised.
Optimise top 10–15 high‑intent pages.
Phase 2 (3–9 months)

Launch new hub pages & cornerstone guides.
Structured data implementation.
Begin content campaigns and PR / backlink initiatives.
Phase 3 (9–18 months)

Expand content into reports, podcasts, regional thought leadership.
Continuous optimisation via data, refine IA, AB tests on key CTAs.
Focus on international positioning keywords.
Slide 29 – Final statement

Something concise:

“DIFC already has strong brand equity. By tightening technical foundations, expanding high‑intent content, and systematically building authority, we can make difc.com the primary organic destination for finance, innovation, and lifestyle in Dubai – and convert that visibility into measurable enquiries and growth.”
3. How to make it look “data‑backed” in practice
Over the next two days, do this quickly:

Run PageSpeed Insights on 3–4 pages and copy the numbers into the slides.
Use a free SEMrush/Ahrefs/Moz check to get approximate:
Domain authority / rating.
Referring domains count.
A few top organic keywords.
Basic Google checks:
site:difc.com for index size impression.
Search “set up business in difc”, “restaurants in difc”, etc., see where DIFC ranks.
Quote these tiny numbers as examples; they prove you actually looked at the site.

If you want, next I can:

Draft actual slide text (short bullet wording) for a couple of key sections like “SEO Strategy & Direction” and “Technical Audit” so you can copy‑paste into PowerPoint/Slides.

i like the presentation structure i have a pro SEMrush account and google score vital and i have the free screaming frog too, also i have a formal color pellet and slides in Figma which i can use, my question is do you recommend i use my AI agents with MCP server to help me out create those slides so i quickly submit

Yes, use your AI agents and MCP to speed this up – but keep yourself in control of strategy and narrative.

Here’s how I’d approach it so you’re fast and impressive.

1. What to do yourself vs. with AI
Do yourself (human):

Final storyline & flow (the structure we outlined).
Strategic choices:
Which keywords are Tier 1 vs Tier 2.
Which opportunities are “high impact / quick win”.
How to frame recommendations in business language.
Prioritisation & KPIs:
Decide what matters most to DIFC (business setup, innovation, wealth, lifestyle).
Set realistic, logical targets.
Use AI agents for:

Turning your bullet points into polished slide copy.
Drafting first versions of:
Title tags, meta descriptions, H1/H2 examples.
Page outlines (e.g., “Business in DIFC” guide structure).
Summarising SEMrush / Screaming Frog outputs into short insights.
Generating charts/tables descriptions that you can recreate in your slide template.
The interviewers are hiring you, not the AI, so the high‑level thinking must clearly be yours.

2. How to integrate AI + MCP efficiently
Use your tools in this sequence:

Step 1 – Collect key data (you)
SEMrush:

Domain Overview: organic traffic trend, top keywords, top pages, main competitors.
Backlink overview: referring domains, authority score.
Position Tracking (if you set a quick project): a small set of core keywords.
PageSpeed Insights / Core Web Vitals:

Run 3–5 pages (Home, Business, Experience, a property, an Insights article).
Note LCP, CLS, Mobile/Desktop scores, main issues.
Screaming Frog (free crawl):

Crawl top ~500 URLs.
Export basic reports: Response Codes, Page Titles, Meta Descriptions, H1s.
You don’t need huge depth, just enough to pull 3–5 concrete data points per SEO area.

Step 2 – Feed data to AI agents via MCP
Examples of smart prompts to your own AI agent:

“Here is a CSV excerpt of Screaming Frog results (titles, meta, status codes).
Summarise the top 5 technical SEO issues and suggest 5 prioritised fixes.”

“Here is the PageSpeed Insights JSON / key metrics for these 3 URLs.
Create a short slide summary with:

current scores,
3 main issues,
3 recommended actions,
a one‑sentence business impact statement.”
“Here are the SEMrush top organic keywords and top pages for difc.com.
Summarise:

what topics DIFC is currently strongest in,
where there is likely opportunity (e.g., low presence for ‘business setup’, ‘restaurants in DIFC’, etc.).”
Then you curate and adjust the output so it matches your narrative.

Step 3 – Use AI for slide text, then layout in Figma
For each section:

Prompt your agent:

“Using this outline, draft 3 bullet points for slide ‘SEO Strategy & Direction – Overview’. Make them concise, executive‑friendly, and data‑oriented.”
Take that copy and paste into your own Figma slide components:

Apply your formal colour palette, typography, icon set.
Convert some bullet points into simple visuals:
2×2 matrix (Impact vs Effort).
Funnel diagram (Awareness → Consideration → Conversion).
Table (Before vs After optimisation).
This way your deck looks custom and professional, not “AI‑generated”.

3. Where AI can most help you save time
High‑leverage uses:

Technical audit summary slides

AI can quickly turn raw Screaming Frog + PSI findings into clean, punchy “problem → impact → recommendation” bullets.
Keyword → page mapping tables

Give AI your priority keywords and existing URLs, ask it to suggest best mapping.
You keep/override the mapping where needed.
Competitor comparison bullets

After you manually open 1–2 key competitor pages (e.g., ADGM “set up a business”), paste sections and ask AI:
“Summarise what ADGM does well on this page vs DIFC’s ‘Business’ page, in SEO/content terms.”
Sample on‑page optimisation examples

For 1–3 pages, ask AI to suggest:
Improved title tag
H1
3 H2s
2–3 FAQs
Including 1–2 concrete examples in the deck looks very strong.

4. Things to be careful about
Don’t let AI invent numbers.
Only include metrics you’ve actually pulled (even approximate). If AI “estimates” anything, ignore it. Use your real SEMrush / PSI / Screaming Frog values.

Avoid generic SEO fluff.
Interviewers hate slides that could apply to any random site. Always tie recommendations to DIFC context:

finance hub,
business setup,
innovation/fintech,
family offices,
Dubai visitors/residents.
Keep narrative consistent.
If you change something in one section (e.g., Tier 1 keywords), make sure it’s consistent in:

keyword slides,
content plan,
KPIs.
Visual polish matters.
Since you have Figma + brand colours, make:

consistent heading hierarchy,
consistent icon style,
1–2 charts based on SEMrush / PSI data (even simple bar charts).
5. A simple workflow for the next 2 days
Day 1 (2–4 hours)

Run SEMrush, PSI, Screaming Frog.
Note key metrics and export small datasets.
Draft skeleton slides (titles only) in Figma, aligned with the structure we outlined.
Day 2 (3–5 hours)
4. Use AI+MCP to turn data into:

technical audit summary,
keyword table,
competitor comparison bullets,
example optimisations.
Paste/refine content in Figma slides, apply design.
Add KPIs & roadmap slides (you write these more manually).
Rehearse your 40‑minute narrative once.
Bottom line:
Yes, absolutely use your AI agents to accelerate research, summarisation, and first‑draft copy.
But keep the strategy, prioritisation, and final wording clearly yours; that’s what they’re evaluating.

If you’d like, you can paste in the raw outputs from SEMrush/PSI/Screaming Frog for 1–2 key pages, and I can help you turn them into slide‑ready bullet points.

Yes, follow that structure and use me your “slide copy engine” whenever you have data.

Here’s how we can work together efficiently:

1. Workflow to follow
You build the empty slide deck in Figma/PowerPoint:

Use the structure we agreed:
Title & agenda
Business & SEO context
Strategy & direction
Technical audit (tech / on‑page / off‑page)
Keywords
Competitors
Opportunities & roadmap
KPIs & impact
Closing
You pull data from your tools (brief, not exhaustive):

SEMrush: top keywords, top pages, domain metrics, a few competitors.
PageSpeed Insights: scores and core metrics for ~3–5 URLs.
Screaming Frog: summary of titles/meta/H1 issues, status codes, etc.
You paste the data to me in chunks and tell me:

Which slide(s) the data is for.
What you want: e.g., “3–4 bullet points for Slide 9: Technical – Site Speed”.
I turn that into slide‑ready bullets:

Short, executive‑friendly, data‑backed.
You then paste into your slides and format.
2. How to send data so I can help best
For each section, send something like:

A. Technical – example prompt from you
“Slide 9: PageSpeed & Core Web Vitals
Here are PSI results:

Home: Mobile 58 / Desktop 91; LCP 3.7s; CLS 0.09; main issues: large images, render‑blocking JS.
/business/: Mobile 63 / Desktop 88; LCP 3.2s; CLS 0.05; similar issues.
/experience/: Mobile 54 / Desktop 86; LCP 3.9s; CLS 0.12.
Create 3–4 bullets:

1 summary of current state,
2–3 recommendations,
1 short business impact line.”
I’ll respond with something like:

Current mobile performance is moderate (scores 54–63) with LCP ~3.2–3.9s, above Google’s <2.5s recommended threshold; desktop scores are stronger (86–91).
Largest performance issues are unoptimised images and render‑blocking JavaScript/CSS across key templates (Home, Business, Experience).
Prioritise image optimisation (WebP, compression, responsive sizes) and deferring non‑critical JS to reduce LCP by 1–1.5 seconds on mobile.
Business impact: Faster pages improve user experience for investors and visitors researching DIFC, and can lift both search rankings and enquiry conversion rates.
You just paste and lightly adjust tone if needed.

B. Keywords – example prompt from you
“Slide 15: Keyword themes
From SEMrush and my research, these are some key terms (with approx. monthly volume):

set up business in difc (X)
difc company formation (Y)
fintech hub dubai (Z)
family office dubai (A)
restaurants in difc (B)
events in difc (C)
Create a table‑style bullet summary: theme, example keywords, intent, priority (High/Med).”

I’ll give you a clean list you can convert into a table.

C. Competitors – example prompt from you
“Slide 18–19: Competitive landscape
From SEMrush:

difc.com: Authority Score 72, ~N organic keywords, top keywords: […].
adgm.com: Authority Score 67, ~M keywords, top keywords: […].
dmcc.ae: Authority Score 70, ~K keywords, etc.
Create 4–5 bullets:

who the main organic competitors are,
1–2 lines on where DIFC is strong,
1–2 lines on where competitors are ahead.”
I’ll create concise comparison bullets suitable for slides.

3. What you can start with right now
If you’re happy with the structure, next steps:

Confirm slide titles (even roughly).
Run your initial tool checks (SEMrush, PSI, Screaming Frog).
Send me:
The titles of 2–3 slides you want to complete first, and
The raw data you have for those slides.
I’ll then:

Turn that into slide-ready bullet points,
Keep them short, structured, and bold the key idea if needed so you can paste directly.
We can go section by section until your full deck is covered.
